Hello, my name is Pawan Gurung and I go by the username @Enduxion online; I am an enthusiastic developer primarily focused on Game Development using C++, Full Stack Application Development, and Programming in general. At the moment, I live in Pokhara, Nepal, and I taught myself how to program since I was 11 but still I enjoy engaging in learning processes till date.

I am a member of several private projects and keep my information to myself while at the same time look for opportunities to work on new projects. Some of my previous experiences are an interest in creative approaches to programming problems and a concern with the best practices in software development.

You can reach me via:

I am ready to apply my knowledge in effective problem solving and interested in the further work in the sphere.
